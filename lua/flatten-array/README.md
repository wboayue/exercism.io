# Flatten Array

Write a program that will take a nested list and returns a single list with all values except nil/null

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.
 
For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]


### Getting started
